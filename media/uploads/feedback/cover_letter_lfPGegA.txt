Hello,

I'm a full-stack developer with 1+ years of experience in developing and deploying web applications.

I am passionate about learning new things and taking on challenges. I have worked on multiple projects in different industries and have decent experience in problem-solving and providing efficient solutions.

I am a web application developer, hard-working and always deliver the work on time.
I have designed many web applications, basically I use MEAN stack for web application development 

I only take the project which I am sure I can do it within time-frame and budget. 

My strong areas of work include : 

1) Frontend development (Angular, Ionic framework).
2) Backend development (Django, Nodejs framework).
3) Database (Postgres, mongodb, sql).
4) Deployment on cloud services (AWS, GCP).
5) REST Api development.
6) Python




Thanks,
SharandeepÂ Singh
